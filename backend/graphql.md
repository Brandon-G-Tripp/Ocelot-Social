# GraphQL

GraphQL is a data query language which provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc web service architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server.

## GraphQL Playground

Your backend is up and running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) This will start the GraphQL service \(by default on localhost:4000\) where you can issue GraphQL requests or access GraphQL Playground in the browser.

You can have direct access to the Neo4j database through [http://localhost:7474/](http://localhost:7474/) for an interactive `cypher` shell and a visualization of the graph. See section **Neo4j Database**.
