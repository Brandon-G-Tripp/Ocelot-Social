# Styleguide

For this Project we decided to use [JÃ¶rg Bayreuther's](https://github.com/visualjerk) _\(visualjerk\)_ fantastic Design System called [CION](https://cion.visualjerk.de/). _\(see a_ [_demo_](https://styleguide.cion.visualjerk.de/)_\)_

## Checkout and Change

All reusable Components \(for example avatar\) should be done inside the [Nitro-Styleguide](https://github.com/Human-Connection/Nitro-Styleguide) repository.

It's now an npm package. Want to help with it's development or maintenance?

If you need to change something in the Styleguide and want to see the effects on the Frontend immediately, then we have you covered. With a local installation you need to clone the styleguide to the parent directory `../Nitro-Styleguide` and run `yarn && yarn run dev`. After that you run `yarn run dev:styleguide` instead of `yarn run dev` and you will see your changes reflected inside the Webapp!

In this case, an interactive documentation appears in your browser.
